    <string name="programming">Programming when i was 8 years old until i went to college looked a lot like this. I thought I was pretty good, had some friends that were a little better at it and they helped me get better and I suspect I motivated them as well.  I remember in my first semester in college when the instructor started talking about arrays.  I got so excited and upset that I went so long without them that I could hardly stay seated to finish hearing him talk about them.  I think once in a while we have moments like that and I enjoy them as often as I can get them.  </string>
